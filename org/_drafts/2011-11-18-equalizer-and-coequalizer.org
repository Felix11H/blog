<p>In my algebraic topology lecture, I learned that <em>product topology</em> constructions are actually categorial products in <strong>Top</strong> and that, dually, coproducts are <em>disjoint union</em> spaces. We even learned that<em> adjunction spaces</em> are pushouts. But when talking about <em>subspace</em> and <em>quotient space</em> topology constructions, apart from the notions being dual to each other, no words about the underlying categorial concepts were lost.</p>
<p>Of course, these are just equalizers and coequalizers. While I found it rather obvious in the case of products &amp; coproducts, I didn't immediately see the correspondence for subspace and quotient space topologies. Specifically, given for example a subspace topology construction, how do you construct a diagram of which the subspace topology is an equalizer of?</p>

<p>In my little article (my first one!) I try to answer that question. I start with defining the concepts of equalizers and coequalizers and show that every equalizer morphism is already a monomorphism. Duality then gives us that coequalizer morphisms are epimorphisms for free. Next I consider equalizers and coequalizers in <strong>Set</strong>. I give the concrete constructions, and show that in <strong>Set</strong>, conversly, every monomorphism may already be interpreted as an equalizer. The dual statement also holds, here the construction felt less obvious and less natural, where representatives of sets of pre-images need to be chosen and one is required to accept the axiom of choice.</p>
<p>With these results I show in the last section that subspace topology constructions do indeed correspond to equalizers and quotient space constructions to coequalizers.</p>
