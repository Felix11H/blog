As an exercise, I show how expected value and variance of various stochastic processes evolve in time.

* Poisson process

Let $(N_t)_{t \in [0,\infty)$ be a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$. Then $\operatorname{E}(N_t) = \lambda t$ and $\operatorname{Var}(N_t) = \lambda t$. Below several paths of a Poisson process are shown. These are well contained within the three time standard deviation $3 \sigma$, where $\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda t}$ from above.
