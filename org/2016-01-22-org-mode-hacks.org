* Handling links

** Don't split the frame when opening links in a new buffer

Achieved by including the following snippet in your ~init.el~, where the value that was changed from default is for ~file~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-link-frame-setup
  (quote (
    (vm . vm-visit-folder-other-frame)
    (vm-imap . vm-visit-imap-folder-other-frame)
    (gnus . org-gnus-no-new-news)
    (file . find-file)
    (wl . wl-other-frame)))
  )
#+END_SRC


** Linking to a specific headline within another org document

This pretty easy and elegant. If ~project.org~ has the following content

#+BEGIN_SRC 
 * headline 1
  ** headline title 2
#+END_SRC

you can link to headline 1 via
#+BEGIN_SRC 
file:project.org::*headline 1
#+END_SRC
and to headline 2 via
#+BEGIN_SRC 
file:project.org::*headline title 2
#+END_SRC

Note, that in the second case, also only one star is used.
