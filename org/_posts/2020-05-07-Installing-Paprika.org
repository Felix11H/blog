Today I installed the recipe manager [[https://www.paprikaapp.com/][Paprika]] on Ubuntu 16.04 using [[https://www.winehq.org/][Wine]]. It is my first time installing an application with Wine and before I forget how I did this, I wanted to make a quick note of the steps I took.

With a quick search I found a couple of forum posts [[[https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=26321][1]],[[https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=30742][2]]] discussing a Wine installation of Paprika. I couldn't get the suggested solutions from these posts to work, instead the method I had success with is described [[https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=38674][here]]. 

I first downloaded the Windows Paprika installer from the app's [[https://www.paprikaapp.com/windows/][website]]. I then installed Wine following the [[https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu][instructions]] for Ubuntu 16.04

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 
wget -O - https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable
#+END_SRC

To get some dependencies I also got [[https://wiki.winehq.org/Winetricks#Installing_winetricks][winetricks]]. I just left the script in home folder and removed after the installation.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Winetricks/winetricks/master/src/winetricks
chmod +x winetricks
#+END_SRC

I then ran
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
winecfg
#+END_SRC
and confirmed that the Windows version is set to Windows 7.

Installing these dependencies took a long time, and I'm not sure if all of this is necessary, but this is the configuration that worked for me. I'm using here the ~winetricks~ script I downloaded earlier.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./winetricks allfonts
./winetricks dotnet472
./winetricks fontsmooth-rgb
#+END_SRC

Finally, I was able to install Paprika via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wine msiexec /i ~/PaprikaSetup.msi
#+END_SRC

After the installtion, the application can be run via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wine "c:\Program Files/Paprika Recipe Manager 3\Paprika.exe"
#+END_SRC

It doesn't look perfect, but I'm happy enough with it!

** Redshift 

I quickly noticed that the Wine application collides with [[http://jonls.dk/redshift/][Redshift]]. When Paprika is started or, for example, the window is resized, screen gamma is changed. This interferes with Redshift's settings and leads to switching between different brightness settings. Here as well a solution is well [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Redshift#Redshift_temporarily_resets_using_some_wine_apps_that_reset_gamma_values][documented]]. 

Start the [[https://wiki.winehq.org/Useful_Registry_Keys][registry editor]] with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wine regedit
#+END_SRC

and in ~HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\X11 Driver~ (you might need to create this key) set ~UseXVidMode~ to ~N~, as shown in the screenshot below.
