<p><strong>Important</strong>: The recordings are now available at the <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/berlin11/webcast">conference website</a>!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/berlin11/index.shtml" target="_blank">Berlin11</a> Satellite Conference for Students and Early Stage Researchers took place on November 18th, 2013. Not being able to attend, I only watched some parts of the livestream broadcast, relying on the <a href="https://twitter.com/R2RC/status/402447504991465472" target="_blank">promise</a> that video recordings of the presentations will be posted shortly after the conference. Three months after the event and after a month of unsuccessfully trying to get a statement from the organizers on whether there's still any chance to see the videos, I realize that neither recordings, nor any other outcomes of the meeting will be published. It's hard for me to understand how a conference on Open Access ends up portraying exactly the closed and inaccessible behaviour, that the concept of Open Access itself is trying to battle.</p>
<p>So I decided to do something about it. Following the <a href="http://www.force11.org/outcomes" target="_blank">example</a> of the Beyond the PDF2 conference, I'm trying to compile an outcomes page with any resources, summaries and reports to the conference I can find. I'm hoping that eventually I would be able to collect at least the presentations of all speakers. So far I'm 4 out of 9 and I want to thank those presenters for making their slides accessible to everyone who couldn't attend the conference. <em>Thank you!</em></p>

<p><strong>EDIT1 (Feb 22, 2014)</strong>: There's good news! One of the organizers of the conference contacted me and explained the situation. Audio recordings of the talks will be published soon (1-2 weeks). I'm also hoping that all presentations will be posted and will link from here once the official site has been updated.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT2 (May 7, 2014)</strong>: Almost three months after my conversation with the organizers about recordings of the talks, neither audio nor slides have been officially posted. I still feel strongly about this topic and I realize that the good intentions of the organizers to make the talks publicly available was (is?) present. For now I hope that in planing potential future events the "post-production" will be considered as in important part of the conference, as it is for those not being able to attend in person the best opportunity to still participate.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT3 (August 7, 2014)</strong>: The recordings have been posted! You can find them at the <a href="http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/berlin11/webcast">conference website</a>. This is fantastic and I hope that with <a href="http://www.opencon2014.org/" target="_blank">OpenCon 2014</a>, a follow-up event to the successful satellite conference in Berlin, coming up, quite some people might be interested in going back and listening to these talks!</p>
