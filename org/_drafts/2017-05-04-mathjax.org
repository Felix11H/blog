#+END_HTML

In LaTeX, using the /amsthm/ package, one can write

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
\begin{theorem}[Prime numbers]
All odd numbers are prime
\end{theorem}
#+END_SRC

to get 

#+BEGIN_HTML
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/amsthm_render.png" width="550px" style="display:block;margin:1.5em auto 1.5em;"/>
#+END_HTML


The goal of this post is to explain how to reproduce this functionality in HTML using [[https://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax]]. One can define the style as

#+BEGIN_SRC css
.theorem {
display: block;
font-style: italic;
}
.theorem:before {
content: "Theorem. ";
font-weight: bold;
font-style: normal;
}
.theorem[text]:before {
content: "Theorem (" attr(text) ") ";
}
#+END_SRC

and then write

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div class="theorem" text='Prime numbers'>
All odd numbers are prime.
</div>
#+END_SRC

to get 

This solution has a bit of history to it. The , after reading his post I added and posted about in my previous blog. Recently, Paul Sieger was able to come up with a solution that should work in most browsers. 

You can try the above implementation conventiently in the a JSFiddle.
